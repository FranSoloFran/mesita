# mesita

**Lightweight MEP arbitrage bot for Argentine markets.**  
Monitors bond pairs, computes implied FX rates, and auto-executes trades under configurable thresholds.  
Features a modular datafeed, risk-control logic, and an open-ended learning architecture for sizing and pair selection.

## Overview

Mesita is a rule-based and learning-augmented arbitrage engine designed to operate across peso and dollar-denominated bond pairs (e.g. `AL30 / AL30D`).  
It continuously monitors market quotes, calculates the implied FX rate (MEP), and executes trades whenever spreads exceed a configurable threshold.  

The architecture supports:
- Paper trading and Live mode (via Primary API)
- Procedural stress testing for execution robustness
- Reinforcement / open-ended learning for adaptive sizing and pair selection
- Detailed trade logs, PnL tracking, and configurable risk limits
